     I learned lots of thing. Computer science, graphic design, electronic, 3D rendering, embeded systems, physics, simulations, electromagnetic waves, energy, economy, woodworking, biology, artifical inteligence  ...etc. Lots lots of thing. Then, I noticed that I know nothing. Then, I noticed that I have to learn something to find new topics to learn. I just noticed yet... We are in a game which has levels. You can't find new things to learn, without learning previous step. Moreover, you can't absolutely see that knowledge exists which is in next level, before completing level which you are in.
